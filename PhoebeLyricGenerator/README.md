# Phoebe Bridgers Lyric Generator

Phoebe Bridgers is an indie rock artist known for her meloncholy tunes and, in particular, her evocotive and poetic lyrics which often
["concern the mundane"](https://www.popmatters.com/phoebe-bridgers-lyrical-melancholy-soothes#:~:text=concerned%20with%20the%20mundane). 
She also happens to be one of my favorite artists. 

I leverage [aitextgen](https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen) to fine tune a mini variant of GPT-2 on a dataset of 43 if her songs, web-scraped using `BeautifulSoup`.
