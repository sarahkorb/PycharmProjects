Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer it's a payment planThere's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn itDo you feel ashamed
When you hear my nameI asked you: How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree
And I said: That makes me feel old
You said: What does that make me?I asked you: How is playing drums?
You said it's too much shit to carry
And what about the band?
You said they're all getting marriedDo you feel ashamed
When you hear my nameAnyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Don't be a strangerYou asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
And now my feet can't touch the bottom of youYou couldn't have, you couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
So I will wait for the next time you want meLike a dog with a bird at your door
We hate Tears in Heaven
But it's sad that his baby died
And we fought about John Lennon
Until I criedAnd then went to bed upset
Now I'm dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themedAnd there's something I'm supposed to say
But can't for the life of me remember what it is
And if I could give you the Moon
I would give you the Moon
You are sick, and you're marriedAnd you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understandI hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at allYou gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go and you didI have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you outI'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it didI have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you outAnd why do you sing with an English accent
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you outYou said when you met me you were bored
You said when you met me you were bored
And you you were in a band when I was bornI have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the soundI'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breatheAnd I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymoreJesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always willI have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappearsAnd last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is deadJesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always willAnd it's 4am, again
And I'm doing nothing
AgainSomewhere in Germany but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back I'll lay aroundAnd I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize the quiet life
There's no place like my room
But you had to go
I know, I know, I knowLike a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go
I know, I know, I know
Out in the park we watch the sunsetTalking on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet and I got mean
Always pushing you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call you come home
A bird in your teeth
So I gotta goI know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it
I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now
I know, I know, I knowDriving out into the Sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America first rap country songA slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolts of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convincedIt's a government drone or alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fenceTo float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said the end is near
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is hereThe end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is hereEmotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sureWake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mineCall me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me downBaby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours and I'll show you mineAll the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yoursDay off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read itI'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind (Woo)Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed?
When you let us drive it
25 felt like flyingI don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mindGuess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liarWhen the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stuccoThe drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sightWhat if I told you I feel like I know you
But we never met?And here everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times alone, and some looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishersMan, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm notWhat if I told you I feel like I know you
But we never met?
It's for the best
I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could, wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stopSomeday I’m gonna live in your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I’ll plant a garden in the yard then
They’re gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousandsI grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframeI don’t know when you got tallerSee our reflection in the waterOff a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wantedWhen I grow up I’m gonna look up from my phone and see my life
And it’s gonna be just like my recurring dreamI’m at the movies
I don’t remember what I’m seeing
The screen turns in to a tidal wave
Then it’s a dorm room like a hedge maze and when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do itI don’t how but I’m taller
It must be something in the water
Everything’s growing in our garden
You don’t have to know that it’s haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment’s getting smaller
No I’m not afraid of hard workI get everything I want
I have everything I wantedI went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
Walden it with you
Any longer, it would have got old
Singing Ace of Spades when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s all right
Sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoirYou, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beachOne of your eyes is
Always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
How Soon Is Now in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're deadYou, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beachI want to live at
The Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while
The lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot-gun, speeding, 'cause fuck the copsAnd you, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beachI buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wallBroke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and goHe gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning Sun rose
He looked at me and saidYou missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good, I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart
Were his last words before he diedLooking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost controlI chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I missed
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed meDriving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin and when she started laughing
And while I clenched down on her wrist, she said, that's quite a list
But there's one thing you missedYou missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missedRunning through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke looseI went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before, everything went darkI said, he missed my heart, he missed my heart
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart
And just before, everything went darkThe most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene, night sky Moon beams
Fishing with my friends sitting in the wild reedsWatching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyardCold was the night and hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out on the streetWhy wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she kept runnin' away from this world
These children are so hard to raise goodWhy wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then be sure to find me
I want you to find me, and we'll play all over
We'll play all over
We'll play all over againThere's a toad in the witch grass, there's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom
As the hills turn from green back to goldWhy wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse
She could do anything she wants to
She could do whatever she wants to doShe could go home, but she's not going to
So she picks a direction, it's ninety to Memphis
Turns up the music so thought don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true
I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wantsOr what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue
So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the Moon
Said she knows she'll live through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor, and I knew thatI would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
I will do anythingWhatever you want me to do, I will do
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)I will do anything (whatever you want)
I will do anything (whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)I cannot believe what you get away with
You find beauty in anything
Whenever you look down into a sewer
You see a diamond ring
It isn't fair how you never look like you're trying
As if you couldn't care any less
And I'm here, kicking myself to keep from crying
You say you're impressedBut this isn't helping at all
It only makes me wanna get further off
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helpingYou can say that this doesn't have to hurt
You're there if you need to be found
Can't you see that that makes it so much worse?
I'll always see you around
Maybe in time, we can give it one morе try
But let's think about what matters now
Keep kicking yourself to keep from crying
That, you'rе so right about'Cause this isn't helping at all
I know you think it's kindness, but it's not
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helpingDon't say that it's all your fault
I know you're backing it at it coming up
But would your life be so bad
If you knew every single thought I had?
'Cause I only have two things to say to you
But you say things about everything, babe
Well, just when I thought
You don't even notice me at all'Cause this isn't helping at all
It only makes me wanna get further off
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helping
This isn't helping at all
I know you think it's kindness, but it's not
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helpingYour imagination
Is in an awful place
Don't believe in manifestation
Your heart'll breakDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhereYou feel it in your nerves
It's choking out the Sun
You try in vain to be persuaded
That it's nothingDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friendYou inherited a fortune
From your mother's side
Your sister didn't get it at all
She survived
Tranquilize the oceans
Between the poles
You're crawling under rocks
And climbing into holesDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friendYour mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friendDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friendFor a chemical imbalance
You sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed
And the music is your maid
When someone comes a-knockin'
With a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you
For you told me not to stayYou are somebody's baby
Some mother held you near
No, it's not important, they're just pretty words, my dear
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No, there's nothing that won't remind you
I will always be right hereAnd you spit the blood back
Spit the blood back, baby
I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home with you tonightWe're both very sick, our muscles are worn down
It's as if we are one-hundred, know I won't still be around
Because I've fallen
Yes, I've fallen right into the love I've found
Long before I reach one-hundred
I'll have fallen to the groundAnd for generations, they'll romance us, make us more
Or much less than ever was before
The Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses
Like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution
Nothing we were fighting forAnd you spit the blood back
Spit the blood back, baby
I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home, I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonightAnd you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea Hotel
And I'll stay out of my own hellOh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home, I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight
TonightI hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
That make you live in the pastBut I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask
Baby, it's Halloween
And we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anythingAlways surprised by what I'd do for love
Some things I'd never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death
Baby, it's HalloweenAnd we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything
Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everythingOh, come on, man
We can be anything
Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you wantWhatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
I'll be whatever you wantLaying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last timeBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see youIf you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking aboutBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see youI used to light you up
Now I can even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it upBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel somethingI'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour inSometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couchBut I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breathCan the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can doBut when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
A machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hairI hope you kiss
My rotten head
And
Pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all
My loveCan the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can doAnd there's nothing I can doI'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cryNot a plane going down
In the ocean and drowningWatched the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outlineI'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself
Now I'm talking to my house plantsNot of being alone
In a room full of peopleWatching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outlineAnd I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thingSilent night, holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peaceSilent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing 'Alleluia!
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is bornSilent night, holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus Lord, at Thy birthI am tired
Of being sad
I feel it when
I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me want to lay down
And get run over
Then I see you
Always smilingMakes me want to touch you
Keep from dying
You’re a brother to me
You’re my partner in crime
You’re the feeling I get when I’m feeling fine
Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won’t fall unless you ask me to We talk for hoursUntil finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamine,
In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don’t touch me
But there’s a danger
You’re a brother to me
You’re my partner in crime
You’re the feeling I get when I’m feeling finePart of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won’t fall unless you ask me to You’re a brother to me
You’re my partner in crime
You’re the feeling I get when I’m feeling fine
Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
I won’t fall unless you ask me toFor a chemical imbalance
You sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed
And the music is your maid
When someone comes a-knockin'
With a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you

I won't be home, I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight
TonightI've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birdsWith the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever
Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believeInstead I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong
You were screaming at the Evangelicals
They were screaming right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetableBecause I think when you're gone it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you
When I dieSometimes when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossibleI want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go homeComin' back from the country
Full of good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloomYou don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix itTethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize youYou don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's so easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix itThe desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good timeYou don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix itYeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix itI got your letter today
And I miss you all so much here
I can't wait to see you all
And I'm counting the days hereI still believe that there's gold
At the end of the world
And I'll come home to Illinois
On the day after tomorrowAnd it's so hard and it's cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin borderWhat I miss, you won't believe
Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrowI close my eyes every night
And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys
About what it means to be a soldierI still don't know how I'm supposed to feel
About all the blood that's been spilled
Will God on his throne get me back home
On the day after tomorrow?You can't deny, the other side
Don't want to die any more than we do
What I'm trying to say is, don't they pray
To the same God that we do?Tell me how does God choose
Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel? Who throws the dice
On the day after tomorrow?Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is brightI am not fighting for justice
I am not fighting for freedom
I am fighting for my life
And another day in the world hereI just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come home
On the day after tomorrowAnd the summer, it too will fade
And with it brings the winter's frost, dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have lost hereI'll be twenty-one today
I been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
And my plane, it will touch down
On the day after tomorrowTake a dirty picture, babe
I can't sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
Tell me what you'll do, pleaseI don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone anymoreYou got quiet on the other line
Said the sun was coming up
And I laughed until I couldn't breathe
Now I'm too tired to go to sleep
Now I can't breathe, and I can't sleepI don't wanna be stoned
I don't wanna be stoned anymoreDon't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymoreI could feel alone
I could, I got a good feeling
It doesn't happen very oftenI'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breatheAnd I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymoreJesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always willI have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappearsAnd last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is deadJesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always willAnd it's 4am, again
And I'm doing nothing
AgainSomeday I’m gonna live in your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I’ll plant a garden in the yard then
They’re gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousandsI grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframeI don’t know when you got tallerSee our reflection in the waterOff a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wantedWhen I grow up I’m gonna look up from my phone and see my life
And it’s gonna be just like my recurring dreamI’m at the movies
I don’t remember what I’m seeing
The screen turns in to a tidal wave
Then it’s a dorm room like a hedge maze and when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do itI don’t how but I’m taller
It must be something in the water
Everything’s growing in our garden
You don’t have to know that it’s haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment’s getting smaller
No I’m not afraid of hard workI get everything I want
I have everything I wantedCold was the night and hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out on the streetWhy wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she kept runnin' away from this world
These children are so hard to raise goodWhy wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then be sure to find me
I want you to find me, and we'll play all over
We'll play all over
We'll play all over againThere's a toad in the witch grass, there's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom
As the hills turn from green back to goldWhy wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?Everything disgusting, conversation is so boring
Heard about what?
I hate her, I don't agree, I did it first
I give a fuck
I just wanna fuck, eat, sleep, love happy
Can you make me happy? Can you keep me happy?Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?I need humanity
Y'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity
Craving humanity
Y'all lack humanity, I need humanity
I needEverybody wanna be beautiful, scared of the unusual
Scared of giving mutual respect, all that you hate
You reflect all that godlike, you forget how to love somebody
I hate everybody, I hate everyoneLet's talk about AI, robot got more heart than I
Robot got future, I don't
Robot get sleep, but I don't power down
I'm wide open, I'm awake, I'm on autopilot
I'm out of my mind and I'm wide openCan you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?I need humanity
Y'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity
Craving humanity
Y'all lack humanity, I need humanity
I needYou said all of my friends are on my payroll
You're not wrong, you're an asshole
Screaming at you in the Ludlow
I was yours for freeI don't get existential
I just think about myself and look where that got me
Standing on my own in an airport bar or hotel lobby
Waiting to feel clean
That's so fucking boringCan you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?I need humanity
Y'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity
Craving humanity
Y'all lack humanity, I need humanity
I need(Those who have forsaken their humanity)
(They like to patch their life with morality)
(I think I might be tryna patch my life with morality)
(I'm curious, I'm curious)I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again, the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without itI just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up
I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always knownI'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for, something I could live forAll the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days
Will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I canWhat lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to loveNo longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse
She could do anything she wants to
She could do whatever she wants to doShe could go home, but she's not going to
So she picks a direction, it's ninety to Memphis
Turns up the music so thought don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true
I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wantsOr what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue
So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the Moon
Said she knows she'll live through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor, and I knew thatI would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
I will do anythingWhatever you want me to do, I will do
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)I will do anything (whatever you want)
I will do anything (whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (whatever you want)I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
That make you live in the pastBut I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask
Baby, it's Halloween
And we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anythingAlways surprised by what I'd do for love
Some things I'd never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death
Baby, it's HalloweenAnd we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything
Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everythingOh, come on, man
We can be anything
Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you wantWhatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
I'll be whatever you wantHave yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sightHave yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles awayOnce again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once moreSomeday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas nowSo have yourself a merry little Christmas nowSomewhere in Germany but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back I'll lay aroundAnd I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize the quiet life
There's no place like my room
But you had to go
I know, I know, I knowLike a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go
I know, I know, I know
Out in the park we watch the sunsetTalking on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet and I got mean
Always pushing you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call you come home
A bird in your teeth
So I gotta goI know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it
I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now
I know, I know, I knowDriving out into the Sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America first rap country songA slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolts of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convincedIt's a government drone or alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fenceTo float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said the end is near
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is hereThe end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is hereLaying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead my whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last timeBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see youIf you're a work of art, I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking aboutBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see youI used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it upBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel somethingI'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour inLaying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last timeBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see youIf you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking aboutBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see youI used to light you up
Now I can even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it upBut I feel something when I see you now
I feel somethingI'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour inIf we make it through December
Everything's gonna be alright, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snowIf we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fineGot laid off at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for my girlI don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why we can't afford no Christmas gearIf we make it through December
Everything's gonna be alright, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snowIf we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fineShe wore faded jeans and soft black leather
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather
When she needed me I wasn't around
That's the way it goes, it'll all work outThere were times apart and times together
I was pledged to her for worse or better
When it mattered most I let her down
That's the way it goes, it'll all work outIt'll all work out eventually
Better off with him than here with meNow the wind is high and the rain is heavy
The water's rising in the levee
Still I think of her when the Sun goes down
Never goes away, but it all works out
Never goes away, but it all works outSometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couchBut I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breathCan the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can doBut when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
A machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hairI hope you kiss
My rotten head
And
Pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all
My loveCan the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can doAnd there's nothing I can doDay off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read itI'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind (Woo)Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed?
When you let us drive it
25 felt like flyingI don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mindGuess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liarYou asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
And now my feet can't touch the bottom of youYou couldn't have, you couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
So I will wait for the next time you want meLike a dog with a bird at your door
We hate Tears in Heaven
But it's sad that his baby died
And we fought about John Lennon
Until I criedAnd then went to bed upset
Now I'm dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themedAnd there's something I'm supposed to say
But can't for the life of me remember what it is
And if I could give you the Moon
I would give you the Moon
You are sick, and you're marriedAnd you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understandI hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at allYou gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go and you didI have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you outI'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it didI have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you outAnd why do you sing with an English accent
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you outYou said when you met me you were bored
You said when you met me you were bored
And you you were in a band when I was bornI have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the soundWhen the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stuccoThe drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sightWhat if I told you I feel like I know you
But we never met?And here everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times alone, and some looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishersMan, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm notWhat if I told you I feel like I know you
But we never met?
It's for the best
I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could, wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stopEmotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sureWake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mineCall me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me downBaby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours and I'll show you mineAll the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yoursWalking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer it's a payment planThere's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn itDo you feel ashamed
When you hear my nameI asked you: How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree
And I said: That makes me feel old
You said: What does that make me?I asked you: How is playing drums?
You said it's too much shit to carry
And what about the band?
You said they're all getting marriedDo you feel ashamed
When you hear my nameAnyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Don't be a strangerI'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cryNot a plane going down
In the ocean and drowningWatched the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outlineI'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself
Now I'm talking to my house plantsNot of being alone
In a room full of peopleWatching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outlineAnd I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thingI went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
Walden it with you
Any longer, it would have got old
Singing Ace of Spades when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s all right
Sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoirYou, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beachOne of your eyes is
Always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
How Soon Is Now in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're deadYou, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beachI want to live at
The Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while
The lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot-gun, speeding, 'cause fuck the copsAnd you, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beachI buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wallI am tired of being sad
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run overBut then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dyingYou're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling finePart of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me toWe talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetaminesIn the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But theres a dangerYou're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling finePart of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I wont fall unless you ask meYou're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling finePart of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I wont fall unless you ask meSummer's end's around the bend just flying
The swimming suits are on the line just drying
I'll meet you there per our conversation
I hope I didn't ruin your whole vacationYou never know how far from home you're feeling
Until you watch the shadows cross the ceiling
Well I don't know but I can see it snowing
In your car the windows are wide openCome on home
Come on home
You don't have to be alone
Just come on homeValentines, break hearts and minds at random
That ol' Easter egg ain't got a leg to stand on
Well I can see that you can't win for trying
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryingCome on home
Come on home
No, you don't have to be alone
Just come on homeThe Moon and stars hang out in bars just talking
I still love that picture of us walking
Just like that old house we thought was haunted
Summer's end came faster than we wantedCome on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Just come on home
Come on home
No, you don't have to be alone

You find beauty in anything
Whenever you look down into a sewer
You see a diamond ring
It isn't fair how you never look like you're trying
As if you couldn't care any less
And I'm here, kicking myself to keep from crying
You say you're impressedBut this isn't helping at all
It only makes me wanna get further off
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helpingYou can say that this doesn't have to hurt
You're there if you need to be found
Can't you see that that makes it so much worse?
I'll always see you around
Maybe in time, we can give it one morе try
But let's think about what matters now
Keep kicking yourself to keep from crying
That, you'rе so right about'Cause this isn't helping at all
I know you think it's kindness, but it's not
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helpingDon't say that it's all your fault
I know you're backing it at it coming up
But would your life be so bad
If you knew every single thought I had?
'Cause I only have two things to say to you
But you say things about everything, babe
Well, just when I thought
You don't even notice me at all'Cause this isn't helping at all

This isn't helping at all
I know you think it's kindness, but it's not
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helpingIf you were a teacher, I would fail your class
Take it over and over 'til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room, I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleedI want to be the power ballad that lifts you up and holds you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all that I want, but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me, I know it's for the betterAnd when broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more?
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains outI want to make you drive all night just because I said maybe you should come over
I want to make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let herI know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the betterKnow it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the betterKnow it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the betterKnow it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the betterPlaying would you rather
When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drownYou were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested
You're the one who tried to burn it downCome to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waitingWe have the same face
I laid awake
As someone shoved you up against a wallQuarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man
And you're twice as tallCome to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waitingNext time I see you you'll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same thingsCome to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touch down I'll be wavingBroke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and goHe gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning Sun rose
He looked at me and saidYou missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good, I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart
Were his last words before he diedLooking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost controlI chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I missed
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed meDriving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin and when she started laughing
And while I clenched down on her wrist, she said, that's quite a list
But there's one thing you missedYou missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missedRunning through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke looseI went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before, everything went darkI said, he missed my heart, he missed my heart
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart
And just before, everything went darkThe most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene, night sky Moon beams
Fishing with my friends sitting in the wild reedsWatching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyardYour imagination
Is in an awful place
Don't believe in manifestation
Your heart'll breakDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhereYou feel it in your nerves
It's choking out the Sun
You try in vain to be persuaded
That it's nothingDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friendYou inherited a fortune
From your mother's side
Your sister didn't get it at all
She survived
Tranquilize the oceans
Between the poles
You're crawling under rocks
And climbing into holesDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friendYour mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friendDon't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend
